SOBRE ESTES DADOS:

Extracted from Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS), which provides a transient simulation of a 
large commercial turbofan engine with a realistic engine control system. Written in a combination of MATLAB and Simulink,
the software supports easy access to health, control, and engine parameters through a graphical user interface. 
Retaining the convenience and user-friendliness of the original, Version 2 includes three actuators (as compared to one) 
and offers an improved controller as well as added actuator and sensor dynamics.
